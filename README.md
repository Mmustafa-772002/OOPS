# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in C++

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) section of the C++ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice Repository. In this section, you will delve into essential OOP concepts using C++. Object-oriented programming is a fundamental paradigm in software development that emphasizes the use of classes and objects to model real-world entities and organize code.

## 1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects." In C++, everything is an object, and these objects interact with each other to perform various tasks. Key concepts in OOP include:

- **Classes**: Blueprints for objects, defining their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).
- **Objects**: Instances of classes, representing real-world entities.
- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (a class).
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in a way that's appropriate for their specific class.
- **Abstraction**: The concept of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features.

## 2. Classes and Objects 

In C++, you'll learn how to create classes and objects to model real-world entities or abstract concepts. A class defines the blueprint, while an object is an instance of that class. Topics include:

- Declaring and defining classes.
- Creating class objects.
- Access specifiers (public, private, protected).
- Member variables and member functions.
- Constructors and destructors.
- Static members.

## 3. Inheritance

Inheritance is a crucial OOP concept that allows you to create a new class by inheriting properties and behaviors from an existing class. Topics include:

- Single inheritance.
- Multiple inheritance.
- Base and derived classes.
- Access control and visibility.
- Method overriding and virtual functions.

## 4. Polymorphism 

Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This concept simplifies code and makes it more flexible. Topics include:

- Function overloading.
- Operator overloading.
- Runtime polymorphism with virtual functions.
- Pure virtual functions and abstract classes.

## 5. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) and controlling access to them. Topics include:

- Public, private, and protected access specifiers.
- Getters and setters.
- Data hiding and information hiding.

## 6. Abstraction 

Abstraction allows you to hide complex implementation details and expose only the essential features of an object. Topics include:

- Abstract classes and pure virtual functions.
- Interfaces and multiple inheritance.
- Design principles for abstraction.
